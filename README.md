### 1. What is project about?

Darknet is a CNN simulator written in C. What we need to do is changing the adders and multipliers to approximate version, maintaining a reletively high accuracy.

### 2. How to run the orignal(unmodified) program?

1. Enter "/darknet", then type in "make" to compile the program.
2. We will be using the pre-trained Tiny YOLO CNN for small and embedded devices. Get the pre-trained weight model from the following link * `% wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3-tiny.weights`
